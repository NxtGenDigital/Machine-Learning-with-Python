# Medical-Diagnosis-using-Support-Vector-Machines
Training of a support vector machine to predict whether a new patient has diabetes based on these measurements. The data set used comes from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and contains anonymous diagnostic measurements for a set of female patients.

## Project Structure
#### The hands on project on Medical Diagnosis using Support Vector Machines is divided into following tasks:

- Load a dataset from file,
- Split a dataset into training and testing subsets,
- Create a support vector machine,
- Make a medical diagnosis for a new patient,
- Evaluate the accuracy of the SVM classifier.
